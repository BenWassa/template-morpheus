  "originalTranscription": "I am standing on a battlefield at dawn, but instead of tanks there are enormous rubber ducks rolling forward on squeaking treads. Soldiers ride them seriously, shouting commands as if nothing is strange. Explosions are replaced by bursts of confetti and sprays of water, yet the ground still shakes. I move between the duck-tanks, helping reload absurd weapons that somehow matter. The scene feels tense and important despite the bright colors and softness.",
  "summary": "The dream depicts an intense battlefield rendered absurd by rubber duck tanks and playful weaponry. Humor and seriousness coexist, creating a strange but emotionally real sense of conflict without cruelty.",
