  "originalTranscription": "I lift off gently into the sky and begin flying above vast clouds. Storm towers rise around me, glowing with internal lightning, while wind rushes past. Sunlight breaks through in golden sheets, illuminating rain and cloud edges. Gradually the lift fades and I begin to fall, not suddenly but slowly, surrounded by storm and wind. There is no panic, only awe, as the fall feels endless and cinematic.",
  "summary": "This dream moves from effortless flight through dramatic storm clouds into a slow, awe-filled fall. The focus is on scale, weather, and cinematic beauty rather than fear or danger.",
