  "originalTranscription": "I'm flying through a crystal city where buildings are made of glass prisms that refract light into rainbows. The streets are rivers of liquid mercury that I surf on invisible waves. People around me have wings made of stained glass, and when they fly, they leave trails of colored light. I try to join them but my wings are made of paper that dissolves in the mercury rivers. The city sings with harmonic frequencies that vibrate through my bones.",
  "summary": "A dream of a crystalline city where light, color, and sound merge into a beautiful but fragile existence. The dreamer yearns to participate but finds their form inadequate for this luminous world.",
