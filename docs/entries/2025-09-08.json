  "originalTranscription": "I find myself in a library where books are alive and whisper their stories to each other. The shelves are endless corridors that shift and rearrange themselves. When I open a book, the story pulls me inside - I become the characters, living their lives in parallel. But the library is burning, pages curling and characters screaming as their worlds collapse. I try to save them but each rescue creates another fire somewhere else.",
