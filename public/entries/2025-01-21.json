  "originalTranscription": "I am already running across rooftops at night. The city is wet with rain and neon lights reflect off concrete. I vault railings, slide under obstacles, and leap impossible gaps without thinking. Something unseen is chasing me, pushing me faster as the city reshapes itself into narrow corridors. Rain intensifies and steam rises as I wall-run, grab ledges at the last second, and keep moving. I am not scared, only focused and capable.",
  "summary": "The dream centers on a fast-paced nighttime parkour chase across rooftops, where an unseen pursuer drives constant motion. The emphasis is on fluid movement, heightened ability, and confidence rather than fear.",
