  "originalTranscription": "I move forward through spaces that blend together. A lush jungle surrounds me with mist, sunlight, and distant birds, every step calm and deliberate. Without transition, the jungle becomes a vast modern office-like interior of glass, polished floors, and soft white light. Plants appear indoors and water flows where it should not. The spaces feel empty but intentional, rewarding attention as I continue walking peacefully.",
  "summary": "The dream is a calm visual journey through connected but impossible environments, shifting from jungle to modern interior spaces. It emphasizes beauty, tranquility, and permission to simply exist and explore.",
