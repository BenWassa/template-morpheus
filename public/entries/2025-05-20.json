  "originalTranscription": "I'm climbing a mountain made entirely of clocks, each one ticking at a different speed and showing different times from around the world. The rocks are clock faces, the trees are pendulums swinging in breeze. Time itself seems fluid here - I can reach out and pull moments from the air like taffy, stretching them or compressing them. At the summit, all time converges into a single perfect moment where past, present, and future exist simultaneously in beautiful harmony.",
