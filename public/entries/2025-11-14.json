  "originalTranscription": "The ocean is made of ink, and I'm swimming through words that form and dissolve around me. Fish are punctuation marks darting between sentences. Ships sail on paragraphs that rewrite themselves mid-voyage. I try to read the water but the words keep changing, telling different stories each time I focus on them. A giant question mark whale surfaces, and when it speaks, its voice is the sound of uncertainty itself.",
  "summary": "An ocean of living text where words and stories are fluid, constantly rewriting themselves. The dreamer navigates this literary sea where meaning is never fixed and stories evolve unpredictably.",
